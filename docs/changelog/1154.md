- Added a NearestNeighborBase class as a parent class for the NearestNeighbor and the NearestNeighborGradient mapping
- Added internals needed for NearestNeighborGradient Mapping implementation. This includes changes to the Mapping, Data and Mesh classes. The Mapping method is not fully functional yet, as it still requires API methods for the user to add gradient data to the mesh.
